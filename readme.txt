Nets D2 for WooCommerce is a plugin that extends WooCommerce, allowing you to take payments via Nets (via the D2 platform).



== DESCRIPTION ==
Nets Payment Services is a leading Scandinavian online payment service provider. Nets can take payment in the following currencies: Danish Krona - Euro - US Dollar $ - English Pound Â£ - Swedish Krona - Australian Dollar - Canadian Dollar - Icelandic Krona - Japanese Yen - New Zealand Dollar - Norwegian Krona - Swiss Franc - Turkish Lire.

To get started with Nets you will need an agreement with Nets as well as your acquiring bank. Visit [Nets](https://www.nets.eu/en/payments/) website for more information.

= How does it work? =
* When an order is placed, the customer is taken to Nets to make a secure payment.
* After the customer completes their payment the order is confirmed and the user is taken to the thank you page on your site.
* Because Nets handle the payment process for you, no SSL certificate is required (but recommended) on your site.

= Multiple payment methods available =
The extension comes with the following payment methods that can be activated/deactivated individually:

* Card payment.
* Invoice payment (via Afterpay/Arvato).
* MobilePay Online (DK & NO).
* MasterPass.

= Subscription support =
The payment gateway also support recurring payments (with the card payment method) via the [WooCommerce Subscriptions](http://woocommerce.com/products/woocommerce-subscriptions/) extension.

= Get started =
